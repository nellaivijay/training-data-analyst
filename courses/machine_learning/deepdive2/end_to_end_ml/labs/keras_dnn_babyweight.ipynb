    "In this notebook, we'll be using Keras to create a DNN model to predict the weight of a baby before it is born.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by defining the CSV column names, label column, and column defaults for our data inputs. Then, we'll construct a tf.data Dataset of features and the label from the CSV files and create inputs layers for the raw features. Next, we'll set up feature columns for the model inputs and build a deep neural network in Keras. We'll create a custom evaluation metric and build our DNN model. Finally, we'll train and evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each learning objective will correspond to a __#TODO__ in this student lab notebook -- try to complete this notebook first and then review the [solution notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/tree/master/courses/machine_learning/deepdive2/end_to_end_ml/solutions/keras_dnn_babyweight.ipynb)."
